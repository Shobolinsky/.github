## Hi there 👋
* Who is Shobolinsky?🤨

Just a bunch of nerds building awesome robots 🤖💡 | Racing to the future, one wire at a time! 🚀

Shobolinsky was born at the end of 2021, when two high school friends decided to turn their wild ideas into reality. Fast forward, and now we’re a team with multiple hackathon wins 🏆, crushing national and international competitions like it's just another Tuesday. We thrive on innovation, always pushing boundaries with fresh, out-of-the-box ideas (sometimes literally out of the box because, you know, we ran out of parts). Stress? What’s that? We’re too busy having fun 😎.

Our obsessions? Robotics 🤖, programming 💻, and space 🌌—basically all things geeky and futuristic.

The Short Story:
We kicked things off building combat robots that looked like rats 🐀. Why rats? Well, they were made from aluminum "L" profiles because, let’s be honest, we were broke 💸. This gave our bots a ratty charm that we’ve kept with each new version—and now, it's kind of our signature style!
